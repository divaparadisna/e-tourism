                Thanks to Waranugraha Ida Sang Hyang Widhi Wasa, we can compile the history of the origin of Payangan, especially Melinggih Village, hopefully "tan kakeneng sosodning sapa muang upadrawa" for the impudence to mention the name of Him who is already Awur ring Acintya. When Bali was still the island of Dawa/Long island where its existence was long before Rsi Markandya came to Bali, so at that time Bali was still a hamlet of hermits, maybe now we call it Wong Bali Aga or Bali Mula. At that time it is said that there was a Rsi who had a hermitage in Munduk Uma Duwur on the south side (around Pura Penataran Ulapan), His name was Rsi Dharma Sadhu who lived with his wife who came from Batukaru hill. One day when the Rsi was walking out of the hermitage, it coincided with the Full Moon of Sasih Kecatur (Full Moon of Kapat) so as usual the Rsi went to a holy place to cleanse himself in a water source, at the same time on that day he saw a beautiful woman who looked shining from a distance, namely in Munduk to the west bordering the river from where he was standing. When the woman walked north, the Rsi continued to pay attention and follow from across the river, apparently the woman was going to the same place, namely the spring which until now is called "Taman Magenda" The Rsi continued to follow the woman from behind the trees, finally it crossed the mind of the Rsi Dharma Sadhu to ask who the woman was.
                <br><br>
                A few moments after the woman returned from Taman Magenda, the Rsi took the opportunity to ask who the beautiful woman was. After the Rsi asked, the beautiful woman said her name, from her soft and gentle speech the beautiful woman said her name was "Dewi Mas Manik Merta Sari" and she was still a girl who came from "Tegal Apit Pangkung" (a field surrounded by river channels). Likewise, the Rsi also told his whereabouts. After the conversation, the Rsi and Dewi Mas Manik Merta Sari became closer, when they returned from Magenda Park he had time to rest and sit under a tree, not far from the Rsi Dharma Sadhu shrine. The longer they spent time together, the Rsi Dharma Sadhu felt something different when he looked into the girl's eyes. The feeling of anxiety and a heart that was in bloom could not be contained, finally came out soft and gentle words from the Rsi's heart expressing his feelings for Dewi Mas Manik Merta Sari, soft words of seduction like a sprinkling of silk hitting the depths of the girl's heart, until finally they declared to love each other, the Rsi also said again, that to commemorate the place if later a village or rice field was formed it would be named "Ujaring Sutra" which means ('Ujar = Words/Raos, Sutra = Soft') soft words, until now a rice field was formed, namely Carik Juring Sutra.

                    Their journey together finally grew closer day by day from the love that grew in their hearts as usual every certain day such as the full moon day (Purnama) he went to the holy water source or "Taman Magenda". This finally became a question in the heart of the wife of Rsi Dharma Sadhu who always paid attention to her husband's behavior who often left the hermitage and came home late, apparently like a proverb it is impossible for someone to cover up the smoke. The wife of Rsi Dharma Sadhu also knew what happened to her husband, where the Rsi also loved another woman besides her. a war of words ensued, the wife's annoyance forced the Rsi to give in and admit his guilt. The hermitage situation is now calm and peaceful again. As the days went by, the presence of the Rsi who was not free from his wife's supervision made the Rsi have to limit going out of the hermitage. He pondered a lot and didn't talk much.

                He really missed meeting Dewi Mas Manik Merta Sari, until one day coinciding with finding the dark moon (Tilem) the Rsi secretly watched Dewi Mas from across the river not far from the west of the hermitage. Seen in the distance of Munduk to the west of the river/Munduk Gunung Sari, a beautiful woman was swinging her steps with a jug on her head, her skin looked radiant, that was Dewi Mas Manik Merta Sari who was heading to "Taman Magenda" her steps seemed hesitant because someone who often accompanied her to chat before was now never heard from. With a heavy heart she tried to look across Munduk Uma Duwur, when she looked around she looked surprised, it was seen from a distance that someone was waving at her. finally she tried to look closer at who the person really was, and finally it was clear, the anxiety they had been holding in was finally slightly cured, wide smiles spread across their faces not a word was spoken and finally they waved to each other. After a while Dewi Mas Manik Merta Sari continued her journey to Taman Magenda. Rsi Dharma Sadhu could only be pensive left by his dream, finally he decided to wait in that place until Dewi Mas returned from Taman Magenda. Every time he saw her he could only greet her by waving his hand. Likewise with the following days, until the place often used for waiting by Rsi Dharma Sadhu was given the name "Ulapan" which means waving hand. 
                <br><br>
                According to Jero Mangku Patri who came from Banjar Melinggih, Kec. Payangan, to the author, that this history/story was obtained from stories passed down from generation to generation during the time of the courtiers, he found in a writing with the old Balinese script spelling that uses Sanskrit. If associated with the names of places until now there are more and more supporters as its truth value. The story of the journey of Rsi Dharma Sadhu, after giving the name Ulapan, his longing for Dewi Mas Manik Merta Sari became increasingly unstoppable, finally he decided to meet his lover, with all the possibilities that would happen to his family, finally he left the pesraman to meet at Taman Magenda. After the two of them met and were going to return they passed Munduk Gunung Sari so that the Rsi would not be known by his wife, when he was resting there Rsi Dharma Sadhu stated that he did not want to be separated again, the Rsi also wanted to go to Tegal Apit Pangkung where Dewi Mas Manik Merta Sari lived, but Dewi Mas did not allow it, with the hope that before the Rsi married her. Finally, there the Rsi stated that he would marry Dewi Mas by getting married or mejangkepan and as evidence to remind the place where he said it was called "Banjar Majangan" finally they both agreed and at that time it was named "Taman Sari" because the beginning of his meeting in Taman Magenda with Dewi Mas Manik Merta Sari was finally combined into Taman Sari. But the previous name was not left alone, the hermitage was named "Taman Sari" and the surrounding area was still called Tegal Apit which is currently called Subak Tegallampit. This also could not be separated from the surveillance of the wife of Rsi Dharma Sadhu, until the marriage/pejangkepan had to make him extremely angry. Moreover, after Rsi Dharma Sadhu returned to the Uma Duwur hermitage, his wife who had been burned by jealousy could not be suppressed anymore. Finally, the wife held a meditation by changing her form into a white pig. With fangs ready to tear anyone who got in the way, thick fur with very scary claws, and growling that almost shook the Uma Duwur hermitage. At that time, the Rsi could only remain silent, unable to do much, the incarnated pig "Angulon Angungsi Lwal" which means heading west towards the river, while screaming he would separate her husband from the woman of his dreams by changing the river into a lake so that Munduk Uma Duwur and Munduk Gunung Sari could be separated.

                The tremendous speed of the incarnate pig began to burn on the riverbank trying to find a water source, the atmosphere became noisy breaking the silence at that time so that it was very surprising. This was also inseparable from the surveillance of the wife of Rsi Dharma Sadhu, until the marriage/pejangkepan had to make him extremely angry. Moreover, after Rsi Dharma Sadhu returned to the Uma Duwur hermitage, his wife who had been burned by the fire of jealousy could not be suppressed anymore. Finally, his wife held a meditation by changing her form into a white pig. With fangs ready to tear anyone who got in the way, thick fur with claws that were very scary, and growling that almost shook the Uma Duwur hermitage. At that time, the Rsi could only stay silent, could not do much, the incarnate pig "Angulon Angungsi Lwal' which means towards the west towards the river, while screaming he would separate her husband from his dream woman by changing the river into a lake so that Munduk Uma Duwur and Munduk Gunung Sari could be separated. The very tremendous speed of the incarnate pig began to burn on the riverbank trying to find a water source, the atmosphere became noisy breaking the silence at that time so that it shocked a hamlet who was fishing. The hamlet did not want his fishing atmosphere to be disturbed by the presence of the pig by making a commotion by breaking the river wall, the pig was shouted at by the Hamlet. At that time the incarnate white pig became very fierce, he began to show off his fangs by growling shaking the river. Then he stood close to the Fishing Hamlet, his red eyes shone, his back hair began to stand up as if he was ready to pounce on his opponent, the Fishing Hamlet looked a little trembling and stepped back a little, seeing the hamlet he was a little afraid of the incarnate white pig even more ferocious, the pig crept and immediately attacked the Dukuh Pancing, his great growl made other animals have to run for cover. It was never expected that the Dukuh would accidentally swing his bamboo fishing rod and hit the incarnate pig. Something impossible happened, the scary pig fell and cried in front of Dukuh Pancing while begging for forgiveness. Apparently the bamboo pacing (Pales Pancing) had the power to repel magical powers. Dukuh Pancing did not stop there, he kept shouting and wanted to hit the pig until finally the pig said. He stated that he would move soon but please remember, that the place that was dug was called Taman Batu Karu / Taman Bukit Batukaru. Because he came from Mount Batu Karu (Tabanan). And the Batukaru spring is still there until now. The wish of the wife of Rsi Dharma Sadhu failed. She did not succeed in separating Rsi Dharma Sadhu from Dewi Mas Manik Merta Sari, finally she stated that she wanted to return to her birthplace, namely Bukit Batukaru. Because of the failure, the pig was shouted at with a bamboo stick until it ran away to the river bank, and when a hamlet was formed it was named Banjar Mancing (now called Mancingan). 
                <br><br>
                The return of the wife of Rsi Dharma Sadhu made the Uma Duwur shrine deserted, still visible traces of the center of devotion in the form of Taulan (statues) Rsi Dharma Sadhu decided to move to Pucak Adri. Meanwhile, Dewi Mas Manik Merta Sari who lived in Taman Sari also explored Puncak Mangenu until finally at (now Pucak Mangenu Subak Tuali). At Puncak Mangenu Dewi Mas liked to plant fruits. One of the most important is called linglang orange (Juwuk Linglang) that's where she founded the shrine, while Rsi Dharma Sadhu also arrived at Pucak Adri, he planted flowers (Sarwa Sekar) The goal was to bind the beautiful woman who was his idol. It turns out that Pucak Mangenu is not far from Pucak Adri, only limited by pangkung (river without water) the daily life of Dewi Mas Manik Merta Sari as usual towards the water of Taman Magenda but over time she had a desire to make the water in Taman Magenda penetrate to the west of the Puck Mengenu shrine, it was successful (Holy Water to the west of the Penataran Air Jeruk Temple now). And Pucak Adri is a place for the Payangan community to perform melasti until now. In the era of hermits/dukuh where people get closer to the Creator is by making Taulan/Arca-arca which until now are still widely found in temples. At this time the island of Bali was still called the island of Dawa/Pulau Panjang, then came a Rsi from Java to explore Pulau Dawa, which was said to look shining. He was none other than Rsi Markandya. Rsi Markandya's journey until the second time was successful, and for the first time he failed. Sometimes people question where the failure is, almost all of the 800 followers died, but rarely does anyone reveal where the real place is.

                According to Jero Mangku Patri's narrative which he also got from the story of the Puri penglingsir during his time as a retainer. That the journey of Rsi Markandya for the first time explored the coast of Dawa Island and began his journey by following the Yeh Wos River/Wos River, after he felt he was in the middle of Dawa Island he tried to meditate for the first time at the Pucak Gunung Lebah Temple (Campuan Ubud) then followed the river upstream, he was still confused about where to start again asking for guidance by doing yoga at the Pucak Payogan Temple and continuing the journey finally arrived at a place there he again asked for guidance to start cutting wood, the place is now at the Murwa Bumi Banjar Pengaji Temple. Because he was followed by 800 followers, to meet/parum when there was an important discussion, a long bale/Bale Agung was built with 98 pillars divided into 48 blocks, 3 blocks were sanctified and 45 blocks were used as a meeting place. Around the bale, many followers built small huts. Then Rsi Markandya continued north to the northern boundary, which is now Pura Alas Anger. But on the way, many of his followers fell ill, it was not even known why, some died immediately until the days became increasingly tense, this is what made Ida Rsi Markandya confused. He began to gather his followers to be invited back but only a few he found, finally he traced the places where his followers cut wood. He found his followers in different places. So according to the circumstances of his followers at that time, a name was made which until now has become the name of Banjar such as: Pilan, Seming, Penginyahan, Ponggang, Semaon and others. Because the sacred place/forest around the place was given the name ALAS ANGKER which means a very magical forest. Rsi Markandya decided to return to Java because he could no longer continue his journey. After arriving at Pucak Adri, he met a woman coming from a holy spring, finally greeted her and was invited to stop by the Pucak Mangenu shrine. Arriving at the peak of Mangenu, Ida Sang Rsi was offered a drink of orange juice (Juwuk Linglang). The woman was Dewi Mas Manik Merta Sari. The treat seemed to give a power to Rsi Markandya and his followers so that those who were sick were cured. Because the power came from the orange juice, the pesraman was called Penataran Air Jeruk. So after that Rsi Markandya decided to return, finally heading to the Raung mountains. There he received guidance to start his journey again on Dawa Island, by getting closer to Sang Hyang Giri Natha (the God who resides on Mount Agung). From Mount Raung to Dawa Island and starting the journey from Pulaki Singaraja Peak (now Melanting Peak).
                <br><br>
                Continue along the middle of Dawa Island towards Mount Agung. There he started again by starting with offerings with the elements of Panca Datu. After returning from Mount Agung towards the west, he finally arrived at a very fertile plain (Alas Jimbar), whatever his followers planted grew well, so that place was called Jagat Sanra Ada (everything exists) which is now the Taro universe. Because for the second time he received revelation on Mount Raung, the Gunung Raung Temple was built in Taro. Then from Taro Ida Sang Rsi returned to Pucak Gunung Lebah, Pucak Payogan and again to the north along the Wos river. Again starting in Payangan, this began at Pura Senetan (Banjar Bayad) from there he started cutting wood for Payangan, after approaching the long bale/Bale Agung, many huts were found that were empty at that time named Karang Suwung until now. It was in Bale Agung that Rsi Markandya began to divide the heaven (Ngepah Kahyangan) in the Village of Kahyangan/Parahyangan. From here he traced his followers when he was first on Dawa Island in Payangan to the north, around Alas Angker because no one else died, it was called Kerta/Kerta Village. That was the northern limit of his journey to Payangan. If to the west until Pura Suka Luwih in Dusun Selat Buahan. From Bale Agung Rsi Markandya continued to focus his mind towards the Mountain, so there was something that he used as his focus to gaze at the peak of Mount Agung from Bale Agung which was called the center of Peganjingan which is now called Puseh Branjingan in Banjar Ulapan Bukian. From his seat, he was given the name "MELINGGIH" which means Sitting. In his journey, there were still many temples that may have escaped our summary as writers. Besides, his followers were also many from the group of Rsi whose spiritual abilities were certainly not much different from Rsi Markandya's so that there were still many temples standing in his time. It should be noted that in writing this history there are certainly inequalities, because in this case the average source is stories passed down from generation to generation which until now no one has written down.
