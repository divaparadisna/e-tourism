                      Most of the Melinggih Village area is agricultural land that has the potential to be used as a tourist attraction. The vast expanse of rice fields, or Rice Terrace, is the main attraction because of its natural conditions, something that is rarely found by foreign tourists in their hometowns. This potential has not been fully utilized as a tourist destination, but the plan is that this expanse of rice fields will be used as a tourist recreation area, either through trekking or cycling activities.
